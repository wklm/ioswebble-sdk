/**
 * SB-SDK-05 — the control on the boundary between the SDK's `BeacioError.from`
 * and the branded card's `presentError`.
 *
 * ─── 2026-08-12: the twins were COLLAPSED; what this file still guards ───────
 *
 * Until this date `error-presenter.ts` re-declared the BeacioErrorCode union, the
 * retriable set, the NotFoundError fragment table and its own message classifier,
 * "because @beacio/core is an OPTIONAL peer of @beacio/detect". That constraint
 * was dead: there is no `packages/detect`, `./detect` is a SUBPATH EXPORT of core,
 * the detect modules already import `../events` / `../urls`, and react-sdk
 * statically imports `@beacio/core/detect` while declaring core a REQUIRED peer.
 * No test ever enforced the rule — two earlier headers here cited
 * `no-toplevel-core-import.test.ts`, a file that never existed. Both layers now
 * classify through `src/error-taxonomy.ts`.
 *
 * Three guards are GONE, because what they asserted is now structurally
 * impossible rather than merely untested: the compile-time `EVERY_CODE` Record
 * (the i18n packs are typed `Record<BeacioErrorCode, string>` over the ONE union,
 * so a new code fails to compile in SRC); the regex-scraped "both twins carry
 * identical fragment tables" pair (there is one table); and the retriability
 * pair (both sides read the same imported `RETRIABLE_CODES`).
 *
 * What remains is what a single classifier does NOT make free:
 *  1. that the shipped COPY for every code is real, non-empty, stack-free and
 *     competitor-free (a content property of the i18n packs);
 *  2. that both layers reach the ADJUDICATED code for the overloaded
 *     NotFoundError and for each of the eleven inputs on which the twins had
 *     silently diverged (see the ADJUDICATIONS block).
 *
 * A THIRD guard — "the literals the SHIPPED emitters throw still classify to
 * their own codes", tree-discovered with a repo-wide backstop (W10-PARITY3) —
 * was DEMOLISHED here by S5-F (2026-08-12) after S5 single-sourced every
 * first-party NotFoundError in packages/core/src/error-conditions.ts. Where
 * each of its properties lives now: row bytes + per-row codes + the
 * classifier-agrees-per-sentence rule + the adjudication/openQuestion prose →
 * packages/core/tests/error-conditions.test.ts (hardcoded-tuple oracle,
 * sentence-group rule, CONDITION_META); the raw-emitter ban, discovery walk,
 * repo-wide backstop with the NON_SHIPPING_EMITTERS allowlist, and the
 * planted-fixture cannot-be-fooled self-test → scripts/ci/
 * check-error-conditions.mjs (+ its __tests__, wired into gate-js and
 * verify-gate); the one licensed page-realm mint count → that lint AND the
 * error-name freeze map (src/beacio/api/error-name-freeze.test.ts,
 * NotFoundError: 1). See S5-DESIGN §5-§6 for the panel verdict.
 *
 * jsdom; @jest/globals import style (project_jest_globals_import_gotcha).

/**
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * W10-PARITY2 — the DUPLICATED NotFoundError CLASSIFIER (strategic review, Risk 5)
 *
 * `error-presenter.ts` used to carry a comment-only-locked COPY of core's
 * NotFoundError classifier ("a local copy of core's `NotFoundReason`
 * (`../errors.ts`) … Keep the two in lockstep"). "Keep the two in lockstep" was
 * enforced by NOTHING until this block: no test ever pushed a
 * NotFoundError-CARRYING-A-CANCELLATION-MESSAGE through the PRESENTER, so the
 * copies could silently diverge — and the user-visible consequence is concrete
 * and bad: a user who dismisses the chooser gets a red "device not found" card
 * instead of a silent cancel. (They HAD diverged, on eleven inputs; see the
 * ADJUDICATIONS block above.) Since 2026-08-12 there is ONE classifier
 * (`src/error-taxonomy.ts`), so these rows now pin that both PUBLIC surfaces
 * still route through it — a re-divergence ratchet, not a copy-vs-copy diff.
 *
 * Web Bluetooth OVERLOADS NotFoundError (Chromium `bluetooth_error.cc` 148-178):
 * a dismissed chooser (CHOOSER_CANCELLED), an origin that never enabled the API
 * (CHOOSER_NOT_SHOWN_API_LOCALLY_DISABLED, :161-163) and a dozen genuine failures
 * all share the DOM name, so the MESSAGE is the only discriminator — which is
 * exactly why two hand-copied message classifiers are a live hazard rather than a
 * cosmetic duplication. 2026-08-12: there is now ONE classifier, whose
 * `NOT_FOUND_FRAGMENTS` rows each carry the full Classification they mean, so a
 * new row cannot be silently defaulted into DEVICE_NOT_FOUND the way the grant
 * wall originally was.
 *
 * Two layers, each of which must RED on a real divergence (the third, a regex
 * scrape asserting the two source fragment TABLES were identical, is deleted:
 * there is one table now, and `expect(x).toEqual(x)` is not coverage):
 *  1. CANONICAL: the exact Chromium cancellation string classified through BOTH
 *     paths — core `BeacioError.from(...).code` and the presenter's rendered
 *     `data-beacio-error-code` — must agree AND equal 'USER_CANCELLED'.
 *  2. VARIANT TABLE: case, stack suffix, US spelling, non-DOMException carrier —
 *     for the cancel string AND the grant-wall string — plus NEGATIVE
 *     NotFoundError messages (a "no devices" failure; Chromium's
 *     WEB_BLUETOOTH_NOT_SUPPORTED / globally-disabled wording; adapter-state
 *     wording). The negative rows are what stop a classifier perturbed to a
 *     constant, or a grant-wall fragment widened to 'web bluetooth' /
 *     'not enabled', from passing.
 *  3. EMITTER — layer DEMOLISHED by S5-F (2026-08-12; see the file header).
 *     "Each shipped literal pinned to its OWN code" is now structural: shipped
 *     emitters can only construct through the CONDITIONS table (gate:
 *     scripts/ci/check-error-conditions.mjs), whose per-row bytes and codes
 *     are pinned by packages/core/tests/error-conditions.test.ts; the
 *     classifier-vs-emitter agreement this layer bought is that suite's
 *     sentence-group rule.
 *
 * RED-arms (adversarial, both directions): perturbing the classifier (e.g.
 * dropping the 'user cancelled' branch in error-taxonomy.ts) MUST turn this
 * block RED; perturbing a shipped emitter row reds error-conditions.test.ts
 * instead. Verified by perturb → RED → revert → GREEN; see docs/reviews/
 * 2026-07-29-chromium-wpt-test-port/fixes/W10-PARITY2.md for the verbatim
 * evidence.

 * pins on the SHIPPED page-realm emitter.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS: `src/extension/page-bootstrap.ts` (`scanUnavailableError`)
 * rejects with a NotFoundError when the origin has NOT enabled the beacio
 * extension. The DOM name is correct and frozen — Chromium maps
 * CHOOSER_NOT_SHOWN_API_LOCALLY_DISABLED onto NotFoundError
 * (`bluetooth_error.cc:161-163`), and the V12-03 headline invariant forbids a
 * NotAllowedError site in the page realm — so the CLASSIFICATION layers are the
 * only place this can be fixed. Before the fix the sentence matched no special
 * case and fell through to DEVICE_NOT_FOUND: an origin that had simply not
 * finished setup was told "No device found", the wrong signal at precisely the
 * onboarding moment.
 *
 * USER DECISION (2026-08-12, explicit): a DISTINCT code, not a reuse of
 * USER_CANCELLED and not an acceptance of DEVICE_NOT_FOUND. `EXTENSION_NOT_ENABLED`
