/**
 * W15 (SRI-01) — committed SRI integrity-table drift guard for the two
 * SRI-pinnable `@beacio/core` browser bundles.
 *
 * The cdn worker serves `cdn.beacio.com/self-host/...` (SRI-pinnable beacio-owned
 * bytes), and operators who pin Subresource Integrity on a `<script>` load need a
 * repo-tracked content-hash (`sha384`) table for the exact bytes they pin —
 * `@beacio/core@1.2.0/dist/auto.mjs` and `dist/browser-auto.global.js`. Until W15
 * no such table shipped: an operator had to compute the digest out-of-band, and
 * the PR's "SRI was regenerated consistently" claim had no committed evidence.
 *
 * THE GREEN ARTIFACT is `packages/core/dist/integrity.json`. It is:
 *   - REGENERATED at build + publish time by `scripts/generate-integrity.mjs`
 *     (wired into packages/core `build` and `prepublishOnly`), and
 *   - TRACKED in git via a `.gitignore` negation that re-includes the
 *     `integrity.json` filename under each package dist dir — the dist bundles
 *     themselves stay ignored, only the hash table is committed; the negation
 *     requires the dir to be non-excluded, hence the repo-root-anchored /dist/
 *     rule plus a per-package dist content-ignore (replacing the old directory-
 *     exclusion form) in .gitignore.
 *
 * tsup's minified output is byte-reproducible for the same source + esbuild
 * version (verified: two back-to-back `npm run build -w packages/core` runs
 * produce identical sha384 for both bundles), so a fresh `build:packages` in CI
 * reproduces the exact bytes the committed integrity.json was generated from —
 * the drift check below does NOT spuriously fail across rebuilds. It FAILS iff
 * the committed integrity.json is stale (bundles changed, table not regenerated)
 * OR tampered (a bundle byte or the table's digest was hand-edited).
 *
 * THIS TEST BINDS THREE INVARIANTS
 *   (a) `dist/integrity.json` EXISTS and is the committed artifact (not a stray).
 *   (b) The table carries a `sha384` entry for each of `auto.mjs` and
 *       `browser-auto.global.js`, plus the `version` it was generated against.
 *   (c) Each committed digest EXACTLY matches `sha384(<freshly built bundle>)`.
 *       A mismatch is either drift (regenerate via `npm run build -w packages/core`)
 *       or tamper (restore the bundle from git) — both are S&B-SRI-critical: a
 *       wrong digest ships a pin the browser will reject against the real bytes.
 *
 * RED-arms (adversarial): flipping one byte of `dist/auto.mjs`, OR editing the
 * committed `integrity.json`'s `auto.mjs.sha384` to a wrong value, MUST turn this
 * suite RED — proving the test binds on the real hash, not a tautology.
 *
 * jsdom; @jest/globals import style (project_jest_globals_import_gotcha).
 * Node builtins via require() (ts-jest emits CommonJS), typed by @types/node
 * through tests/tsconfig.json.
 *
 * Run via
 *   npm --prefix packages/core test -- sri-integrity-table
 * The gate runs build:packages before test:packages, so the dist bundles (and the
 * freshly-regenerated integrity.json) exist by the time this runs.
